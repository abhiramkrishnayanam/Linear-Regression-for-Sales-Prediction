# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains an implementation of **Linear Regression**, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## Overview

Linear Regression models the relationship between dependent and independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. This project demonstrates:

- Building a simple or multiple linear regression model.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Visualizing the results.
- Interpreting the model's performance metrics.

## Features

- Implementation of Linear Regression using Python.
- Support for both simple and multiple linear regression.
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Model training and testing.
- Visualization of regression results.
- Calculation of key metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared (R²)**, etc.

## Results

The model predicts the target variable with a certain level of accuracy.

### Visualizations include:
- Scatter plots with the regression line.
- Residual analysis plots.

## Key Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about advertising expenditures across three media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and their corresponding sales. Each row represents a different observation.

## Columns:
* TV: Advertising budget allocated to TV (in thousands of dollars).
* Radio: Advertising budget allocated to Radio (in thousands of dollars).
* Newspaper: Advertising budget allocated to Newspaper (in thousands of dollars).
* Sales: Sales generated (in thousands of units).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to predict a continuous target variable based on advertising expenditures across different channels. By analyzing the dataset, we successfully:

- Built and evaluated a linear regression model to understand the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
- Identified the effectiveness of each advertising channel in driving sales.
- Visualized key patterns and assessed the model's performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R².

The results highlight the potential of Linear Regression as a simple yet powerful tool for predictive modeling and decision-making in business scenarios.
